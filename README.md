# bouncing-smiley
This is just a thing that bounces a smiley around a window. 
Yes, it is currently set to a black screen, but that can be easily changed.
Overall, this is a very simple and kinda silly program that I used to get the hang of github co-pilot. 
It was a pretty fun mini project to work, despite a few kinks in how co-pilot handled a few things.

# Changing the color
On line 50 in main.cpp, change the first three values of the function to values between 0 and 255. 
This will be the RGB value to determine what color your background will be.
