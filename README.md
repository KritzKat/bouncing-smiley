# bouncing-smiley
This is just a thing that bounces a smiley around a window. 
Yes, it is currently set to a black screen, but that can be easily changed.
Overall, this is a very simple and kinda silly program that I used to get the hang of github co-pilot. 
It was a pretty fun mini project to work on, despite a few kinks in how co-pilot handled a few things.
Also, a disclaimer: I have only run this on Manjaro so far, so be sure to build it on your own using the Makefile provided if you are on a different OS. Shoot me a message if it doesn't work, and I'll fix it as soon as I'm available.

# Changing the color
On line 50 in main.cpp, change the first three values of the function to values between 0 and 255. 
This will be the RGB value to determine what color your background will be.
